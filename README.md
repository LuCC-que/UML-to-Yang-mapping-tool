# From UML to Yang

## About:

### The objective of this undergraduate thesis project is to develop a translation tool for converting UML to the Yang language for Telus. While a significant portion of this field remains unexplored, this project also aims to investigate the limitations of translating UML to Yang. The primary objective of this project is to identify and document any engineering challenges encountered during the translation process, summarizing the findings in a professional report.
